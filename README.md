basics of SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query language.
It is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, 
deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.

SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language
This database language is mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. It is a special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables).


## Databases
database is an organized collection of data so that it can be easily accessed. To manage these databases, Database Management Systems (DBMS) are used.
In general, there are two common types of databases:
#### Non-Relational -In Non-RDBMS, data is stored in key-value pairs.
#### Relational - In RDBMS, data is stored in tabular format.
